You can meet other helloSystem users and developers at [`#helloSystem:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#helloSystem:matrix.org) from any Matrix client (such as the Element web-based Matrix client). This Matrix channel is [bridged](https://matrix.org/blog/2015/06/22/the-matrix-org-irc-bridge-now-bridges-all-of-freenode) to the IRC channel (which we intend to move from freenode to libera.chat). Joining via Matrix has the advantage that you will see responses that you may have received while you were offline. So after asking a question, you can come back in a day or so to see if there were any responses.

In any case, please stay in the channel for a few days and do not expect to receive answers immediately, since we are all volunteers.
